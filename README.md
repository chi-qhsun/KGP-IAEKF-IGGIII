# KGP-IAEFKF-IGGIII

## Loose Coupling of GNSS/INS Using IA-EKF, IGGIII and KGP Methods Based on KF-GINS 

## Introduction

This paper expands on prior research by integratingcutting-edge adaptive algorithms, including IAE-KF, IGGIII, and KGP. This ensures increased accuracy and resilience in loosely connected GNSS/INS systems to improve estimate procedures and handle dynamic noise and non-linearities.

We also ported existed EKF integrated GNSS/INS navigation system: [KF-GINS](https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/KF-GINS/) from C++ to Python for further development of Machine Learning Algorithm.

## 1 Program Compilation and Execution

### 1.1 Compilation environment

KGP-IAEKF-IGGIII is compiled on Windows.

The configuration file is used as a parameter to run Main.py after successfully compiling it. To debug the program, it is also required to add the configuration file as a parameter.

This project recommends using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for managing Python environments and dependencies. The following steps will guide you on how to set up and activate a conda environment suitable for this project.

Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new conda environment named kgp_env with Python version 3.8 using the following command:
```shell
conda create --name kgp-IAEKF python=3.8
conda activate kgp-IAEKF
conda install -c conda-forge absl-py pyswarm scikit-learn pyyaml pyquaternion
```
absl-py: A library from Google providing application-level infrastructure and various Python utilities.

pyswarm: A particle swarm optimization (PSO) library.

scikit-learn: A powerful Python module for machine learning and data mining.

pyyaml: A library for YAML file parsing and output.

pyquaternion: A library for handling rotations in three-dimensional space using quaternions.

### 1.2 Compile under Windows

We recommend you to compile in the VSCode software.

You should first install the Python compiler and VScode software (including the necessary plug-ins, such as Python, Python Extension Pack).

After preparing your own compilation environment, you can clone the repository locally and open the KGP-IAEKF-IGGIII folder in **VSCode**:

- Set Interpreter: open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Python: Select Interpreter", select **Python 3.8.x (kgp-IAEKF)**

After setting your configuration, open Main.py in the folder,click run:

The Application will automatically run and generate result in expexted directory. 

Default path: ./NavResult

## 2 Use KGP-IAEKF-IGGIII

### 2.1 Prerequisite Knowledge

**Frame defination:**
- IMU frame: the origin is the IMU center, the three axes point forward-right-down
- Navigation reference frame: the origin coincides with the IMU frame, the three axes point north-east-down

**Navigation state:**
- position: the geodetic coordinates of the IMU position in the Earth frame (latitude-longitude-ellipsoid height)
- velocity: the IMU velocity to the Earth projected in the navigation reference frame (north speed-east speed-down speed)
- attitude: IMU attitude to navigation frame (quaternion, direction consine matrix, or euler angles. euler angles are defined as yaw-pitch-roll, ZYX rotation order)

**IMU noise model:**
- IMU measurement noises are modeled as the Gaussian white noise
- IMU bias errors are modeled as the firt-order Gauss-Markov process
- IMU scale factor errors are modeled as the firt-order Gauss-Markov process

### 2.3 Initial align

KF-GINS only supports initial alignment given all initial states currently. The initial states need to be set in the configuration file (kf-gins-real.yaml) before executing the program.

## 3 Activate KGP

Please set configuration KGP to **True**, if KGP prediction is needed.

## 4 Datasets

We use demo dataset with the configuration file, which is located in the **dataset** directory. Data directory can be set in configuration file.

## 5 Result

The Final Result is located in "NavResult" folder.
